# TODO Interactive Thresholding isn't working properly yet. Also show the total numbers.
# TODO Instead of priority/propensity side to side have a drop-down to select which property to show
# TODO show volume change and distribution change, experiment with showing delta with a grouped bar chart; underlying data may be one DF with a column for the "condition"
# TODO can then also show expected sum of propensities for the top-1 ranked items. Win loss looks similar.

"# Analysis for Propensity and Priority thresholding"

"""
Analysis of the propensity and other arbitration factors.

There will be an easy way to see the effects of thresholding on volume and distribution of
the actions.

* What is the effect of new offers (new models with propensity 0.5, showing a peak there)?
* What should my priority / propensity threshold be and how does this effect the volumes and distributions? You will want to see this for a specific channel, which can easily be accomplished by globally filtering on that channel only.
* Is the random control group working? (propensity spreading 0-1)
